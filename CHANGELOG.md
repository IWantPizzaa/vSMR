# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- Added `NOVA` icon style and icon-trail support.
- Added `Rounded Corners` tag option in the profile editor (`Icons & Tags -> Behavior`).
- Added persistent `labels.rounded_corners` profile key (global across tag types/statuses).

### Changed
- Renamed profile editor icon label from `Realistic` to `Icons`.
- Reworked icon-shape layout in the profile editor to two rows:
  - top: `Icons`, `NOVA`
  - bottom: `Arrow`, `Diamond`
- Moved icon-style selection out of the top `Target` menu; it is now managed in profile editor only.
- Updated About panel content and credits alignment with repository attribution.
- Bumped plugin/version metadata to `v1.1.2`.

### Fixed
- Fixed clipping issues in profile editor cards and controls at narrow widths.
- Fixed severe lag while resizing the profile editor window.
- Optimized icon rendering path, including realistic/icons mode hotspots.
- Fixed structured tag-color rule behavior so hover/detailed tags preserve normal rule colors when no detailed override exists.

### Repository
- Removed stale `tmp_alexis_upstream` gitlink/submodule entry.
- Removed `vSMR/Release_cli` build artifacts from repository tracking.

## [1.1.1]

### Changed
- Major profile JSON cleanup and normalization for `tags`, `icons`, and structured `rules`.
- Added migration path from older profile keys to the normalized layout.
- Simplified tag editor model around `Departure` and `Arrival` statuses.
- Aligned rules editor `Type` and `Status` options with tag classification.
- Improved arrival icon-state handling:
  - `Gate` remains separate
  - other on-ground arrival movement states use `On Ground`
- Unified profile list ordering (`Default` first, then alphabetical).
- Fixed profile editor selection sync when profile changes from radar menus.
